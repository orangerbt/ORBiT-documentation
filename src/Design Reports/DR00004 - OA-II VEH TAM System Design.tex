\chapter{Requirement Analysis}
\section{General Requirement Analysis}
The TAM system requirements can be divided into two parts. The first part is the bridge which transfers data from a low speed parallel sensor connection to the high speed serial backplane. The second part is controls, which configure all the sensors to connect to the board and execute basic unit transformations.
\section{Bridge Requirement Analysis}
The TAM sensor unit needs to be have to bridge different data buses to the backplane data bus. The TAM sensor unit needs to support: 
\section{Control Requirement Analysis}
The TAM sensor unit needs to be able to configure the sensor to the correct state and execute basic data transformation to transfer data to real physical values. The delay should not be more than 100ms and should support up to 32 channels.

\chapter{Current Controller Analysis}
\section{Microcontroller}
It does come with many interface options. However, it does not have a high speed interface needed for connections between other systems. It is different than the requirement, which needs a few kind of interfaces with high speed connectivity.
\section{FPGA Soft Core Processor}
A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing â€“ hence the term "field-programmable".\cite{Cite Needed} Almost every FPGA company will have it own soft core processor. This allows the core to be easily reprogrammed, as it is formed by "logical synthesis" and allow the user to rebuild them in the FPGA chip as long as the chip has enough resources. However, the speed of this soft core processor will not be as fast as the SoC processor. Although, it is fairly easy to interface to other systems.\section{SoC FPGA}
The SoC FPGA is another kind of FPGA. The difference is the embedded, more powerful processor know as hard core processor. It helps fuse the benefit between the SoC chip and FPGA chip designs. On one hand, it allows a big system to run in the powerful hard core processor, and, at the same time, the flexibility of an FPGA chip allows a custom interface and upgradibility. However, SoC FPGAs have less logical resources compared with a classic FPGA and weak proessing power when compared with SoC which is the same cost.\newpage
