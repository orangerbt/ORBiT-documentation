A quick overview of the electronics test bench.

\includegraphics[width=7in]{EI00002_overview.jpg}

1. DAQ board. Allows for pressure transducers and other resistive measurement devices to be converted to a usable analog signal. Used with the National Instruments ADC (USB-6000).

2 Fuses. Provides separate fuses to parts of the system. Namely, one fuse to drive high-load circuitry (ignition and solenoids) and one to drive the remaining system.

3. Beaglebone Black Stack. The main computational stack that will be tested and programmed.

4. Relays and Relay-Drivers. A temporary installment that allows the Beaglebones' GPIO pins to directly drive a high load through a relay.

5. DC-DC 24V Step-up Converter. A DIN-rail device that will step up the battery voltage (~12V) to the a higher 24V used by the relays (I bought the wrong ones).

6. DC-DC 5V Power Regulator. A through hole 5V step mode power regulator to provide 5V power to various systems.

7. Power Switches for main and secondary power.

\section{Usage guide}
The test bench as it is currently is built to allow for actuation of a solenoid valve and an ignition coil, with the ability to add more high-power devices to the empty relays. It also provides signal conditioners for 2 force transducers and a pressure transducer.

To utilize the relays, the corresponding GPIO pin on the Beaglebone has to be driven high (or low, I don't remember). However, the first relay is meant as an enable for the remaining relays (see circuit diagram above) to allow for a safety interlock. In addition, the switch labeled SECONDARY must be enabled to allow for relay actuation to allow for manual override.\\
NOTE: When using the relays, make sure to set the pin mode to OUTPUT (i.e. run the script BEFORE turning on SECONDARY power) as a floating output may cause false triggers.

To utilize the signal conditioners, attach the National Instruments ADC to a computer running LabVIEW (namely the Japanese "still better than a mac" laptop). Run the LabVIEW program on that computer to start recording data.

\section{Additional notes}
The two fuses in the fuse box are rated loosely to protect the remaining circuitry. The higher rated fuse is meant to provide power to high-power devices (Ignition \& solenoid). The lower rated fuse provides power to the rest of the system.
Note that these fuses have not been tested, and a short on the ignition coil will cause all systems to crash.

\textbf{CAUTION:} All information contained in this documentation may be inaccurate or wrong. The test bench is not meant to be a final device and is built crudely at best.

\textbf{DO NOT USE IN CRITICAL APLICATIONS}
